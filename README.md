FriCAS is the first computer algebra system to
be able to work with elements in the universal field of
fractions of a free associative algebra. Now you can convince
yourself. I guess that it takes a while to get used to working
with linear representations (admissible linear systems). For
small polynomials that really looks like an overkill. But for
example in the

on page 15 one can see the beauty of Cohn's
theory. You should try p_43^-1 ...
